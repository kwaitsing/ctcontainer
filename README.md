# Must-know before using
1. ctcontainer is not a **Virtual Machine**, it just a container like docker but with less restriction
2. ctcontainer is not a **sandbox**, run virus on it is **extremly dangerous**, I'm not responsible to the damage of your system caused by that, the safety level depends on your settings and the backend(currently systemd-nspawn or chroot)
